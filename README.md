# freax.components

We will have our component's code here . you can either go with [quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me/) ( recommended because of performance ) or [ags](https://aylur.github.io/ags/) ( it uses js , so it will be easier to work with ) 

- create your own seperate branch 
- if you are going with only one of the above libraries , you can create widgets directly in your root directory  ( like ./bar.js or ./widget.qml)
- if you want to use both of them then create two seperate folders for ags and quickshell . 
  
# Design & Inspirtion stuff
- i have created a [penpot](https://penpot.app/) team page , where we can design and brainstorm designs . you'll have to dm me to join it tho because it needs an email address. ( lemme know if you have any other good alternative to this )
